# EX 6 C Program to print the string "KEYBOARD" n number of times.
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C Program to print the string "KEYBOARD" n number of times.

## Algorithm
 1. Input a number: Read an integer value from the user (a).
 2.Initialize a counter: Set i = 1 to track iterations.
 3.Loop condition check: Ensure i is less than or equal to a.
 4.Print "KEYBOARD": Display the word in each iteration.
 5.Increment counter: Increase i

## Program:
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a,i=1;
    scanf("%d",&a);
    while(i<=a)
    {
    printf("KEYBOARD\n");
    i++;
    }
}
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program was executed and the output was verified successfully.
